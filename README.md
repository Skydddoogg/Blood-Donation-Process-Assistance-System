# Blood-Donation-Process-Assistance-System
Blood Donation Process Assistance System is a system for assisting with pre and post-donation processes. This system is separated into two platforms, web application and mobile application. Hospital staff will use the web application for donor registration, donation record and qualification verification. A donor will use the mobile application for seeing his/her donation history and for completing his/her pre-donation qualification form. The mobile application is built on [Java](https://www.java.com), and the web application is built on [Python (Flask Framework)](http://flask.pocoo.org/). Moreover, [Firebase real-time database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIttPPh9yK4QIVhQ4rCh2y7gddEAAYASAAEgJcbfD_BwE) is applied to this system.
